Using Hash Table ADT to manage credit accounts 
##
Hash table is one of the best data structures to save, find, and modify unique objects, or data. 

Amongst linear/quadratic probing, separate chaining and double hashing methods, we decided to choose double hashing.
In Hash Table ADT, insertion, search and removing operations takes O(1) time on average. However, it can take twice as much as memory comparing to other hashing methods, to keep load factor less than 0.5.
