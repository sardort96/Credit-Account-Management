Using Hash Table ADT to manage credit accounts 
##
Hash table is one of the best data structures to save, find, and modify unique objects, or data. 

Amongst linear/quadratic probing, separate chaining and double hashing methods, we decided to choose double hashing.
In Hash Table ADT, insertion, search and removing operations takes O(1) time on average. However, it can take twice as much memory as  compared to other hashing methods in order to keep the load factor less than 0.5. In Uzbekistan, each person has a 7-digit passport number. This number is unique for every citizen. We used it as a key to generate the hash code. We used Vector ADT to dynamically resize our hash table because it can dynamically change its size when needed.
